                <p>Weathering with You (天気の子, Tenki no Ko, Child of Weather) is a Japanese animated film by Makoto Shinkai. It is his sixth feature film.

                    First announced on December 13, 2018, it premiered on July 19, 2019 in Japan.</p>
                <h2>Plot</h2>
                <p>Japan is going through an unusually rainy spell. A girl in her teens, Hina Amano, spots a beam of sunlight at a crumbling shrine on top of a rundown building while she cares for her ailing mother in a hospital nearby. Hina steps away from her mother's side and makes her way to the shrine, passes through its gate, and is briefly whisked away to a realm that appears to be floating in the sky.</p>
                <p>High-school freshman Hodaka Morishima flees from his home and relocates to Tokyo. During his journey, he nearly gets tossed off a ferry due to an unexpected rainstorm. However, he is rescued by a man named Keisuke Suga, who offers Hodaka his business card in case he ever needs assistance. Once in Tokyo, he has difficulty making ends meet since he cannot work legally because he is a runaway minor. After being asked to leave a lift lobby that he had been using as a shelter, he discovers a gun in a trash bin and decides to keep it as a good luck charm, believing it to be just a toy. He has a brief encounter with Hina at a fast-food restaurant where she is employed, and she feels sorry for Hodaka, treating him to a complimentary meal. Hodaka reaches out to Suga and is taken on as an assistant at his small publishing company. At the office, Hodaka meets Natsumi, Suga's niece, whom he mistakenly believes is Suga's mistress. They explore urban legends concerning the strange weather patterns in Tokyo; from a psychic, they learn about the tale of a 'sunshine girl' and a 'rain girl'—a girl capable of controlling the weather.</p>
                <p>On a rainy day, Hodaka observes as Hina is coerced into working at a dubious club and tries to save her. They flee, but the club host chases after them. Although he gets pinned down by the host, he surprises him by firing the gun he discovered earlier. The two teens find refuge in a nearby abandoned building where Hina scolds him for intervening, clarifying that she needed the job to support herself and her sibling after being let go from her previous position at the fast-food restaurant. However, she begins to warm up to him and showcases her ability to clear the sky through prayer. Motivated by the notion of a 'sunshine girl', Hodaka visits Hina at her residence and suggests they launch a business together; Hina would use her unique power to provide clear weather for clients with special occasions. Their venture becomes extremely successful, drawing in a diverse clientele from kindergarten children to major corporations. He also meets Hodaka's younger brother Nagi at Hina's house. Suga and Natsumi continue their investigation into the urban legends about the enigmatic girl who can alter the weather. They consult a priest who shares the tale of a weather maiden whose powers come with a significant sacrifice.</p>
                <p>In Hina's apartment, Hodaka conceals himself in the bathroom while the police question Hina about Hodaka's location. It comes to light that Hodaka's parents have reported him missing, and the officers are looking into his alleged possession of illegal firearms. One officer tells Hina that social services will be notified to take Nagi, Hina’s younger brother, away since they are minors without a legal guardian. After the police depart, Hodaka meets Suga in his car, who terminates his employment and provides him with severance pay. Suga expresses regret for being unable to assist Hodaka further, as he wishes to avoid any issues that could hinder his custody application for his daughter.</p>
                <p>Hodaka chooses to flee with Hina and Nagi, but the weather deteriorates further as it unexpectedly begins to snow. While on the streets, the three are intercepted, and Hodaka is captured by two police officers as he tries to escape, but Hina comes to the rescue by diverting the officers’ attention through her prayer for lightning to strike close by. This enables the trio to make their getaway to a hotel.</p>
                <p>They spend the night at a hotel. Just as they are about to sleep, Hina reveals to Hodaka that her body is gradually turning into water, and she learned from Natsumi about the tale of the weather maiden who becomes a living sacrifice; normal weather will only return if she permanently vanishes into the clouds. He vows to protect her and refuses to let this happen. However, the next day, Hina goes missing, and the rain subsequently halts. Hodaka decides to search for her, but he and Nagi are apprehended by the police before they can leave the hotel. Hodaka escapes from the police station and receives assistance from Natsumi as she happens to be passing by. The police pursue Hodaka until he reaches the building with the shrine where Hina first gained her powers. Inside, he runs into Suga, who tries to prevent him from escaping any further. The police manage to enter the building and surround Hodaka. Concerned for the desperate Hodaka, Suga aids him in fleeing from the Takai police, followed by Nagi, who intervenes to stop Yasui. Hodaka reaches the top of the building and leaps through the shrine. He then finds himself transported above the world in the sky, where he saves Hina. As they plummet to earth, Hodaka implores Hina to begin living for herself, and the rain resumes with no indication of stopping.</p>
                <p>After three years, Hodaka, who has been on probation, finishes high school and comes back to a now partially submerged Tokyo. He goes to see Suga, who has grown his business, to discuss meeting Hina. He then sets out to find Hina, as he hasn’t spoken to her in the past three years. While walking on a rainy day, he spots Hina praying at the opposite end of the street, and the two finally come together again.</p>
