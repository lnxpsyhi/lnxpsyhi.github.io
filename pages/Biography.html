                <p>Makoto Shinkai (新海 誠, Shinkai Makoto), born as Makoto Niitsu (新津 誠, Niitsu Makoto), is a Japanese director, writer, producer, animator, editor, cinematographer, voice actor, manga artist and former graphic designer.

                    He is best known for directing Your Name., one of the highest-grossing anime films of all time, and was listed by Variety as one of 10 animators to watch in 2016. Asteroid 55222 Makotoshinkai is named after him.</p>
                <h2>Life</h2>
                <p>Born in Nagano Prefecture, Shinkai pursued Japanese literature at Chuo University, where he participated in a juvenile literature club and illustrated picture books. He attributes his creative passion to the manga, anime, and novels that influenced him during his middle school years. His favorite anime is Hayao Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky. Several reviews, including those from Anime Advocates and ActiveAnime, have dubbed Shinkai as "The New Miyazaki," a label he considers an "overestimation."

                    He is married to former actress and producer Chieko Misaka, known for her roles in films like Versus by Ryuhei Kitamura; together, they have a daughter, child actress Chise Niitsu, who was born in 2010.</p>
                <h2>Career</h2>
                <h3>The Beginning</h3>
                <p>After completing his studies at Chuo University in 1994, he began his career at Falcom, a video game company, where he spent five years creating video clips for games and engaging in graphic design, including web content. During this period, he met musician Tenmon, who would go on to score many of his films.

                    In 1999, Shinkai produced She and Her Cat, a brief five-minute monochrome short. The piece garnered multiple awards, including the top prize at the 12th DoGA CG Animation contest in 2000. DoGA is a nonprofit organization aimed at supporting novice animators with software and guidance. The short portrays the life of a cat purely from its viewpoint, as it passes time with its owner, a young woman.
                    
                    Following his success with the grand prize, Shinkai began contemplating a follow-up while still employed at Falcom. In June 2000, he was inspired to initiate Voices of a Distant Star after sketching a girl in a cockpit holding a cell phone. Later, he was approached by Manga Zoo (now a smartphone app), which offered to collaborate with him, providing funds to adapt his concept into a sellable anime. In May 2001, he left his position at Falcom and started working on Voices. In an interview, Shinkai mentioned that the production took about seven months of intensive work.</p>
                    <h3>As a Feature Animation Director</h3>
                    <p>Voices of a Distant Star was succeeded by the 90-minute film The Place Promised in Our Early Days, which debuted nationwide in Japan on November 20, 2004. It received critical acclaim and earned numerous awards. Shinkai's subsequent project, 5 Centimeters per Second, premiered on March 3, 2007. This work is composed of three short films: Cherry Blossom, Cosmonaut, and 5 Centimeters per Second, with a total duration of approximately 63 minutes. In September 2007, Nagano's prominent newspaper, Shinano Mainichi Shinbun, aired a TV commercial that was animated by Shinkai.

                        Shinkai spent the year 2008 in London, taking a break after completing 5 Centimeters per Second. He returned to Japan in 2009 to begin working on his next film. In December 2009, he shared two concept illustrations for this project. Shinkai indicated that it would be his longest animated feature to date and described the storyline as a "lively" film filled with adventure, action, and romance, following a cheerful and spirited girl embarking on a journey to say "farewell." In November 2010, he announced that his next film would be titled Children Who Chase Lost Voices from Deep Below. A teaser trailer was unveiled on November 9, and the movie had its release on May 7, 2011.
                        
                        His following feature, The Garden of Words, came out on May 31, 2013.</p>
                    <h3>The Unexpected Major Success</h3>
                    <p>On August 26, 2016, Shinkai premiered Your Name. The movie garnered positive reviews, receiving accolades for its animation and emotional depth, and it achieved significant commercial success, ranking as the third-highest-grossing film ever in Japan and, as of January 16, 2017, the highest-grossing anime film in history, surpassing Miyazaki's Spirited Away.</p>
