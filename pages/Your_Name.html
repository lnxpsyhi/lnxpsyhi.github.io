                <p>Your Name. (君の名は。, Kimi no Na wa.) is a Japanese film written and directed by Makoto Shinkai. It is his fifth feature film.

                    Premiered in Japan on August 26, 2016, it quickly becomes Shinkai's most successful film so far, being one of the highest-grossing Japanese film both in Japan and worldwide.</p>
                <h2>Plot</h2>
                <p>In the mountainous Hida region of Japan, a high school girl named Mitsuha Miyamizu resides in the town of Itomori. Feeling unfulfilled with her rural life, she longs to be a dashing boy in her next life. She unexpectedly starts exchanging bodies with Taki Tachibana, a high school student from Tokyo, each time they awaken. They manage to communicate by jotting down notes on paper, texting each other, and even writing on one another's skin. Mitsuha influences Taki to form a bond with his colleague Miki Okudera, while Taki helps Mitsuha gain popularity at her school.</p>
                <p>One day, Taki, in Mitsuha's body, goes with her grandmother and sister to leave the ritual sake kuchikamizake, which Mitsuha created, as a tribute at the mountaintop shrine outside the village. This shrine is thought to symbolize the physical form of the guardian god of the village, who governs human experiences and relationships. Mitsuha's latest message informs Taki about a comet that's set to pass by Earth on the day of her town's festival.</p>
                <p>The following day, Taki wakes up to find he is in his own body. After an unsuccessful date with Miki, he attempts to call Mitsuha but fails to connect, marking the end of their body-switching. Determined to go to Itomori, he struggles to remember its name as his recollections fade, and Mitsuha's messages have vanished. A restaurant owner in Hida finally identifies Itomori from Taki's drawing and informs him that when the comet unexpectedly split in two, the smaller fragment crashed into Earth and annihilated the town. Taki discovers Mitsuha's name in the list of casualties and learns the date of the catastrophe, realizing their timelines are three years apart.</p>
                <p>Taki visits the shrine to consume Mitsuha's kuchikamizake, hoping to reconnect with her spirit and warn her about the impending comet collision. Through a vision, Taki learns that Mitsuha, who has fallen for him, encountered his past self while attempting to meet him in person. He awakens in her body on the day of the town festival; Mitsuha's grandmother recognizes his presence and informs him that the body-swapping is part of the Miyamizu family's legacy as guardians of the shrine. He persuades Mitsuha's friends, Katsuhiko Teshigawara and Sayaka Natori, to assist in evacuating the town by shutting off the power and sending out a fake emergency alert, but the strategy fails. He then realizes that Mitsuha must be at the shrine in his body and returns to find her.</p>
                <p>Mitsuha awakens in Taki's body at the shrine. As Taki arrives at the shrine during sunset, they feel each other's presence despite being three years apart. However, when twilight arrives, they switch back to their own bodies and finally meet. They try to inscribe each other's names on their hands to help them remember, but as twilight fades, Mitsuha vanishes before she can write her name.</p>
                <p>As Mitsuha hurries back to town to detonate the Power Plant and persuade her distant father, the mayor of Itomori, to evacuate the area, her memories of Taki begin to blur. She comes to the realization that instead of writing his name, Taki had inscribed "I love you" on her palm. A fragment of the comet crashes to Earth, devastating Itomori. Taki awakens in his own time at the shrine, with no recollection of what happened.</p>
                <p>Five years later, Taki has completed his university degree and is looking for employment. He feels as though he is lacking something crucial and discovers that the people of Itomori survived by heeding the mayor's directive. One day, while Taki and Mitsuha are on their trains, they spot each other as their paths align and feel an urge to get off and find one another, ultimately reuniting on a staircase. They have a sense of familiarity from a previous encounter and simultaneously inquire about each other's names.</p>
