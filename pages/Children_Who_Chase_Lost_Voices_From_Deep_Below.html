                <p>Kodomo, lit. "Children Who Chase Stars", also known as Journey to Agartha, is a 2011 Japanese anime film created and directed by Makoto Shinkai. It is his third feature film.

                    The film was released in Japan on May 7, 2011. With the running time of 116 minutes, this was the longest movie of Makoto Shinkai as of now.</p>
                <h2>Plot</h2>
                <p>In 1973, Asuna Watase is a young girl in elementary school who has had to mature rapidly ever since her father's passing, while her mother, a nurse, does long hours at the hospital. Asuna fills her lonely days by listening to the enigmatic tunes coming from the cat's-whisker receiver that her father gifted her as a keepsake, together with her pet cat Mimi, who has unusual red markings on her fur.</p>
                <p>One day, as she was making her way to the clubhouse over a bridge, a terrifying creature attacked her, but a mysterious teenage boy named Shun saved her. After tending to Shun's injuries from battling the creature, Asuna and Shun listened to her radio together. Shun explained that he was from a distant land called Agartha and had come to this place to search for something. He then bestowed a blessing on Asuna with a kiss to her forehead. Asuna quickly left, telling Shun she would return the next day. Alone now, Shun gazed up at the stars and fell from the ledge, meeting his demise.</p>
                <p>The following morning, Asuna learns from her mother that a boy has been discovered dead in the river, but she refuses to accept that it's Shun. In class, Mr. Morisaki, a substitute instructor, delivers a lecture on a book that captures Asuna's interest when he brings up Agartha, the land of the deceased. After school, she seeks out Morisaki to inquire about Agartha. Morisaki describes how, in ancient times when humanity was still young, it relied on the guidance of Quetzalcoatls, the guardians of the dead, until humans grew up and no longer needed their assistance. Those guardians then retreated underground along with a handful of humans who chose to follow them.</p>
                <p>Afterward, Asuna heads to her hideout and discovers another enigmatic boy resembling Shun standing on the ledge. At that moment, a group of armed individuals known as the Arch Angels appears and attacks both of them. The mysterious boy takes refuge in the underground entrance with Asuna, and they venture deeper into the cave when the entrance is bombarded. They encounter a Quetzacoatl that has seemingly lost its physical senses and launches an attack on the boy. He chooses not to kill the gatekeeper, hands Asuna his clavis, a crystal, and defends himself. The Arch Angels intervene, resulting in the gatekeeper's death. The Arch Angel commander captures Asuna and uses the clavis to create a portal to Agartha. The commander and Asuna step through the portal, followed by the boy. Once they enter, the commander reveals himself as Morisaki, while the boy introduces himself as Shin, Shun's younger sibling. Morisaki tells Shin that his sole desire is to resurrect his deceased wife. Shin departs from Asuna and Morisaki.</p>
                <p>Morisaki informs Asuna that she has the option to return, yet she chooses to stay with him. Together, they enter the realm through an underwater passage. Upon entry, they make their way to the Gate of Life and Death, a portal that has the ability to resurrect souls, accompanied by Mimi, who had secretly hidden in Asuna's bag.</p>
                <p>When Shin returns to his village, he learns that he has failed his mission to obtain the clavis, as Asuna has inadvertently brought back a piece of it. Shin sets out once more to prevent Asuna and Morisaki from causing chaos in Agartha.</p>
                <p>Asuna is captured by a monster race known as the Izoku. She regains consciousness in a confined space and encounters a young girl named Manna; together, they attempt to escape but are unsuccessful. The day starts to darken, and the Izoku begin to emerge, moving only in the shadows. During their escape efforts, they come across Shin, who assists them but is injured by an Izoku. Morisaki locates Asuna, Manna, and the wounded Shin by the river with Mimi's help. Shin attempts to reclaim the clavis crystal fragment that belongs to Asuna. However, he is too weak to fight back, and Morisaki quickly overpowers him. Asuna persuades Morisaki to allow them to take Shin along while Manna leads them to her village.</p>
                <p>Upon arrival, the villagers are initially hesitant to assist the "top-dwellers," but the village elder persuades the guards to grant them entry. The elder permits them to spend one night in the village as they have returned with Manna, but they cannot stay longer due to the village's history of misfortune caused by top-dwellers. In the meantime, Asuna inquires about Shin, but he shouts at her to go away.</p>
                <p>The following morning, Asuna and Morisaki leave Amaurot by boat, but Mimi chooses not to join them anymore. Later, Shin awakens to discover that Mimi has died; he, Manna, and the elder then carry Mimi's body to the Quetzacoatl. When Shin notices the villagers setting out to attack them, he resolves to follow in order to protect Asuna. As Morisaki and Asuna approach a steep cliff, they are ambushed by the villagers, but Shin comes to their rescue. Asuna attempts to descend but is too frightened, while Morisaki continues on after exchanging his gun for her clavis shard and instructing her to return to the surface.</p>
                <p>At the same time, Shin is battling the villagers and is on the verge of death when they realize that the clavis crystal has reached the boundary of Life and Death. The villagers abandon Shin, allowing him to roam without purpose, having turned against his homeland.</p>
                <p>Asuna, adhering to Morisaki's advice to remain in the water at night due to the Izoku, wanders without purpose and reflects on her reasons for coming to Agartha; she eventually realizes that her journey was motivated by her feelings of loneliness. When the water recedes, she is assaulted by the Izoku but is rescued by Shin once more. After witnessing the Ark of Life descend, the two make their way back to the cliff. They come across a dying Quetzalcoatl. Before its passing, the Quetzalcoatl sings a song to share its memories with the world; Asuna now comprehends that the last melody she heard in her realm was Shun's song before his death. The Quetzalcoatl offers to guide them to the base of the cliff.</p>
                <p>At the base of the cliff, both of them discover the Gate of Life and Death and step inside. Morisaki has already wished for his deceased wife, Lisa, to come back, but her spirit needs a host. Asuna and Shin encounter Morisaki, who warns Asuna that she shouldn't have come; soon, she is taken over by the spirit of Morisakiâ€™s wife. However, this sacrifice is not enough; Morisaki also forfeits one of his eyes. To free Asuna from the possession, Shin shatters the clavis crystal, even with a knife pressed against his throat by Morisaki. Breaking the clavis restores Asuna's soul to her body after a brief reunion with Mimi and Shun. Before departing from Asuna's body, Lisa instructs Morisaki to seek happiness without her. Asuna regains her usual self, but Morisaki is crushed and pleads with Shin to end his life. Shin points out that shouldering the weight of a lost loved one is a human affliction, urging Morisaki to continue living. Asuna returns to the surface, bidding farewell to Shin and Morisaki, who has opted to remain behind. The film concludes with an older Asuna gazing out her window at the cliff where she had encountered Shun and Shin. She then says her goodbyes to her mother as she rushes to her graduation ceremony.</p>
