                <p>The Place Promised in Our Early Days ( 雲のむこう、約束の場所, Kumo no Mukō, Yakusoku no Basho, lit. "Beyond the
                    Clouds, the Promised Place") is a 2004 Japanese animated science fiction war drama film produced,
                    written and directed by Makoto Shinkai. It is his first feature film.

                <h2>Plot</h2>
                <p>After the separation in Japan in 1974, the northern island of Hokkaido (referred to as Ezo in the anime) was taken over by the "Union" (implying the Soviet Union). That same year, the Union began constructing an unusual tower on Hokkaido, designed by a scientist named Ekusun Tsukinoe. The anime follows three friends living in Aomori, northern Japan: Hiroki Fujisawa and Takuya Shirakawa, both child prodigies, and a girl named Sayuri Sawatari. In 1996, when they are in ninth grade, they become intrigued by the Hokkaido Tower visible across the Tsugaru Strait. Sayuri forms a close bond with the two boys.</p>
                <p>The boys discover a downed drone from the Maritime Self-Defense Force and decide to rebuild it, receiving help from Mr. Okabe, their boss at a military plant. They vow to fly to Hokkaido to see the Tower, but before they can fulfill their promise, Sayuri mysteriously vanishes over the summer.</p>
                <p>Three years on, Takuya and Hiroki have abandoned their plane project and gone their separate ways due to their grief over Sayuri’s disappearance. Takuya now works as a physicist at an Alliance facility funded by the U.S. National Security Agency, exploring parallel universes with Ms. Maki Kasahara, under Professor Tomizawa's guidance. They’ve discovered that since its activation in 1996, the Hokkaido Tower has been replacing nearby matter with that from other universes, though the reason for its 2-km radius effect remains unknown. Takuya becomes involved with the Uilta Liberation Front after learning that its leader is Mr. Okabe, whose factory workers are also agents of the group. Okabe recruits Takuya for a mission to Ezo with Uilta.</p>
                <p>Sayuri has been in the hospital for the last three years due to a severe case of narcolepsy, causing her to sleep almost constantly during that time. Her consciousness is trapped in a deserted parallel universe where she exists all by herself. Tomizawa has learned that she is connected to the Union's investigations into parallel universes and the Hokkaido Tower's capacity to alter the surrounding area into alternate realities, but he initially keeps this knowledge, along with her location, hidden from Takuya</p>
                <p>Takuya ultimately discovers the most plausible explanation from a coworker – that Sayuri had been exploited by her grandfather, a Union physicist, to direct the Tower's chaotic dimension-generating energy away from Earth; the consequence of him failing to do so would likely have led to a chain reaction around the tower, causing it to extend until it consumed the entire planet. Heartbroken, he returns to the abandoned warehouse where he and Hiroki were assembling the plane, only to encounter Hiroki, who urges Takuya to assist him in completing the aircraft to rescue Sayuri. He coldly aims a gun at Hiroki and demands that he choose between Sayuri and the World without pausing for a response – walking away, overwhelmed with anguish.</p>
                <p>With Okabe’s direction, Takuya secures his colleague and takes Sayuri from the NSA facility – Takuya and Hiroki reunite to complete their work on the plane. Takuya assists in finalizing the plane's programming, as they strategize to use the impending declaration of war against Ezo as cover to fly to the tower and obliterate it before its rays impact everything on the planet, ultimately saving Sayuri.</p>
                <p>The aircraft has capacity for only two passengers, so Takuya lets Hiroki take control and honor their childhood vow. Hiroki successfully pilots the plane across the strait to the Tower, carrying Sayuri and a missile supplied by the Uilta Liberation Front. When Sayuri finally awakens while the plane circles the Tower, it activates and begins to alter the surrounding landscape; the transformation quickly spreads to cover a large portion of Hokkaido. In her final moments of unconsciousness, Sayuri understands that when she opens her eyes, she will lose all memories of her dreams from the past three years, leading her to cry upon awakening, as she has unknowingly forgotten her love for Hiroki. As they head back, Hiroki launches the missile to destroy the Tower, halting the matter transformation. The film concludes with Hiroki promising Sayuri that they will begin their relationship anew.</p>
