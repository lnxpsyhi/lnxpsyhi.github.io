                <p>Suzume (すずめの戸締まり, Suzume no Tojimari) is the seventh feature film produced by Makoto Shinkai. The Japanese title was revealed on December 15, 2021. The film was released on November 11, 2022.</p>
                <h2>Plot</h2>
                <p>Suzume Iwato, a 17-year-old high school student, resides with her aunt in a town located in the Kyushu region. One morning, she suddenly awakens after dreaming of being a child in a field under a starry sky, with a woman in front of her whom she tries to remember by calling her "Mom." On her way to school, she encounters a young man who inquires about any nearby ruins with a door, and she directs him to an old, abandoned spa in the mountains. After meeting some of her friends, her curiosity is piqued, leading her to attempt to find the young man at the abandoned spa. Upon her arrival, she discovers a door that she decides to open, which reveals the same field and sky from her dreams. As she walks around, she trips over a cat statue on the ground, which unexpectedly transforms into a real cat and scurries away. Startled, Suzume hurriedly returns to school. During lunchtime, she observes a large plume of smoke rising from the direction of the abandoned spa; when she tries to alert her friends, she realizes they are unable to see the massive column. She quickly races back to the spa and finds the young man from earlier struggling to close the door. Suzume assists him, and together they succeed in shutting the door. The column of smoke then causes an earthquake in a nearby area.</p>
                <p>Suzume brings the man to her house, where he reveals his name is Souta Munakata and explains that he is a "Closer." He must find and secure specific doors in deserted locations across Japan to stop a powerful "worm" from escaping and triggering earthquakes. While they converse, the cat from the spa shows up and, after receiving food from Suzume, speaks to her, leaving her surprised. The cat, named Daijing, then transforms Souta into the chair he was sitting on. Now a small, three-legged chair, Souta chases the cat onto a ferry heading to Ehime, with Suzume following him. The cat jumps to another ship as Souta explains to Suzume that the cat is a "keystone" and that the worm was unleashed after she unknowingly removed the keystone from near the door.</p>
                <p>The next morning, they arrived in Ehime and saw several online posts from locals about the missing cat. In their search, they met a girl named Chika Amabe, who had just accidentally dropped her boxes of oranges from her scooter. Suzume helped Chika gather the fallen load, and they chatted for a while; however, upon spotting another worm, Suzume asked Chika to join her at a nearby abandoned school, where Souta taught her how to securely close the door with a special key to prevent another earthquake. They spent the night at Chika's Inn, where Suzume assisted her friend with some cleaning before heading to bed. The following morning, they continued their journey after noticing that Daijin was crossing a bridge toward Kobe. When it started to rain, they halted at a bus stop and received a lift from Rumi Ninomiya, who drove them to Kobe and then asked Suzume if she could look after her children. After amusing the two kids, Suzume helped at the bar, but she had to flee when she spotted Daijin inside, who took her to an abandoned amusement park where another door appeared. They successfully locked the door, causing the worm to vanish. Souta clarified that the portal within the door connects to the Ever-After, a realm where souls go following death.</p>
                <p>After locating Daijin in Tokyo, Souta requests Suzume to guide them to his apartment. There, he shares the tale of the worm "Namazu" and reveals that he is the final descendant of a lineage that has long been responsible for sealing all the entrances to the Ever-After. He explains that there are two keystones that contain the worm: the western keystone has manifested as Daijin, while the whereabouts of the eastern keystone remain unknown. He cautions that if the worm attempts to surface in Tokyo, it could trigger an earthquake as catastrophic as the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. They soon realize that the worm is emerging, prompting them to search for the door it is coming from. The worm takes on a massive form in the sky and prepares to descend as the two manage to "fly" above it; there, Daijin reveals that Souta is now the Keystone and that to prevent an earthquake, they must use Souta himself to seal the worm. Suddenly, Souta transforms into a keystone, and with reluctance, Suzume uses him to confine the gigantic worm. Suzume then awakens at a shrine that houses the Tokyo gate, where she sees Souta in the Ever-After but cannot access the door. Daijin subsequently appears and attempts to speak with Suzume, but she kicks him away and shouts at him to never return. She then visits Souta's grandfather, Hitsujirō Munakata, at the hospital, seeking to learn how to rescue Souta. He clarifies that Suzume's ability to perceive the worm and the Ever-After through doors indicates that at some point in her life, she entered the realm via one of those doors. Additionally, he notes that the door she first used is the only way she can re-enter the Ever-After to save Souta.</p>
                <p>She decides to head to the Tōhoku region, where she spent her childhood and experienced the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami, during which she lost her mother. Along the way, Suzume encounters Souta's friend, Tomoya Serizawa, who wants to assist her in locating Souta, accompanied by Suzume's aunt, Tamaki, who has been searching for Suzume to bring her back to Kyushu. Suzume declines to return and hops into Serizawa's car. Tamaki follows suit with Daijin, and they make their way to Tōhoku. They are compelled to halt midway due to the rain, as Serizawa's car roof is malfunctioning. During this pause, Suzume and her aunt engage in a heated argument, influenced by Sadaijin, the eastern Keystone, who then decides to join them. Sadaijin reveals his ability to speak, causing an accident that sends the car tumbling into a ditch; Suzume, her Aunt, and the two cats abandon Serizawa and continue on a bicycle. They discover her childhood home and retrieve a time capsule containing Suzume’s old diary, which confirms that the door was nearby. They locate the door, and Suzume, Daijin, and Sadaijin enter while leaving Tamaki behind. Once in the Ever-After, Sadaijin transforms and attempts to combat the worm, while Suzume and Daijin rescue Souta, who reverts to his human form. Understanding the implications of his newfound freedom, Daijin sacrifices himself to become a keystone, and alongside Sadaijin, who also reverts to a keystone, they are utilized by Souta and Suzume to permanently seal the worm in the Ever-After.</p>
                <p>While still in the Ever-After, Suzume spots a little girl who is actually her 12-year younger self. Suzume reassures her younger self that the chair will give her the strength to face the tragedy and continue to grow. Young Suzume then travels back to the past by passing through the door again, while Suzume and Souta make their way back to the present and shut the door. Souta heads back to Tokyo, while Tamaki and Suzume return home, reconnecting with the friends Suzume made throughout her journey.</p>
                <p>Months later, as Suzume attends school, she encounters Souta once more on the same street where they originally met.</p>
