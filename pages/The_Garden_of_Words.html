                <p>The Garden of Words (言の葉の庭, Kotonoha no Niwa) is a 2013 Japanese anime drama film written, written and directed by Makoto Shinkai. It is his fourth feature film.

                    The film was released on May 31, 2013.</p>
                <h2>Plot</h2>
                <p>As the rainy season begins in Tokyo, Takao Akizuki, a 15-year-old student with dreams of becoming a shoemaker, chooses to skip his first class to draw shoe designs in Shinjuku Gyo-en's garden. There, he meets Yukari Yukino, a 27-year-old woman who is avoiding work and savoring beer and chocolate. Upon noticing the school emblem on his uniform, Yukari bids him farewell with a poem, leaving Takao intrigued about its meaning and source. The pair continue to run into each other and bond in the park on rainy mornings, yet they never formally introduce themselves. When Yukari shows interest in Takao's shoemaking, he decides to craft a pair of shoes in her size. As the rainy season comes to an end, Takao stops visiting the park and shifts his focus back to his work.</p>
                <p>After the summer break, Takao returns to school and notices Yukari. His friends inform him that she is a literature instructor who has been subjected to gossip and harassment. Out of compassion and to prevent further conflict, Yukari decided to avoid work and retreat to the park, hoping to conquer her fears and learn to "walk" again. However, she ultimately quits her job and leaves the school. That afternoon, Takao encounters Yukari at the park and greets her by quoting the 2,514th poem from the Man'yōshū Japanese poetry anthology, which is the appropriate reply to her poem that he discovered in a classic Japanese literature book. After getting drenched by an unexpected thunderstorm, they both head to Yukari's apartment and spend the afternoon together. When Takao confesses his feelings for her after dinner, Yukari is visibly touched but reminds him that she is a teacher and is returning to her hometown in Shikoku. Following Takao's abrupt departure, Yukari realizes her error and chases after him, finding him in the stairwell. Still feeling hurt, Takao angrily retracts his statement and critiques her for being so secretive and not opening up to him. Yukari hugs him, and they both cry as she explains that their moments together in the park had saved her.</p>
                <p>In the credits, it's revealed that Takao just manages to pass his final exams but continues to strive for his aspirations, while Yukari relocates back to Shikoku to continue her teaching profession. During a post-credits sequence, Takao returns to the park in winter, reads a message from Yukari, leaves her completed shoes on the bench, and promises that he will search for her once he has advanced in his career.</p>
