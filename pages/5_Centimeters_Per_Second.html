                <p>5 Centimeters per Second (秒速5センチメートル, Byōsoku Go Senchimētoru) is a 2007 Japanese animated romantic drama film produced, written and directed by Makoto Shinkai. It is his second feature film.

                    It premiered at Cinema Rise in Shibuya, Tokyo on March 3, 2007.</p>
                <h2>Plot</h2>
                <p>Two children stroll side by side as the petals of cherry blossoms drift down. After the girl shares that a cherry blossom petal falls at a speed of 5 centimeters per second, she dashes to a train crossing and swiftly goes across it. On the opposite side of the lowered barrier, she makes a vow to the boy that they will enjoy the cherry blossoms together next year.</p>
                <p>Takaki Tōno encounters Akari Shinohara while in the fourth grade of elementary school. Both of them frequently relocate due to their parents' jobs, making them feel uncomfortable in social situations; however, their shared experiences help them forge a strong friendship. Takaki shares his aspiration of becoming a cosmonaut with Akari, who supports him in chasing that goal. As their relationship deepens, rumors start circulating about them being more than friends. Near the end of elementary school, Akari learns that her family must move to Iwafune. Although she wishes to attend the same junior high school in Tokyo as Takaki, she ultimately has no choice but to accept the situation. On graduation day, Takaki is unable to properly say farewell to Akari.</p>
                <p>In middle school, Takaki and Akari maintain their connection through letters. However, as time goes on, their correspondence slows down. When Takaki's parents inform him that they will be moving to Tanegashima, he decides to meet Akari while he still has the opportunity. On the day of their reunion, he carries a letter that he hopes will express his feelings to her. Unfortunately, a severe snowstorm causes a delay in the train, and he arrives in Iwafune several hours later than planned, losing the letter along the way; however, Akari is still waiting for him. After enjoying a bento she prepared for him, they stroll around in the snow and share a kiss in front of a cherry tree before finding a shed to spend the night. The following morning, Takaki boards the train to Tokyo, with Akari assuring him that he will be okay regardless of what happens.</p>
                <p>In 1999, Takaki is now in his third year of high school in Tanegashima, where the Tanegashima Space Center is situated. Kanae Sumida, a classmate of Takaki, has harbored feelings for him since they met in junior high but has never mustered the courage to express them. She attempts to spend time with him, lingering after school in hopes of the opportunity to go home together. However, Takaki seems oblivious to Kanae's emotions and treats her merely as a close friend. Kanae notices that Takaki often sends emails to someone or gazes into the distance as if he is searching for something far removed. It is eventually revealed that Takaki's emails are not directed to anyone specific, and he experiences recurring dreams featuring Akari. After a thwarted effort to confess her love to Takaki, Kanae ultimately understands that he is in search of something much greater than she can provide and decides against revealing her feelings, though she believes her love for him will endure.</p>
                <p>It is the year 2008. Takaki is now working as a programmer in Tokyo. Meanwhile, Akari is making plans to marry another man. Takaki continues to yearn for Akari, which negatively impacts his life choices. He receives a call from his current girlfriend but chooses not to answer, indicating the end of their relationship. Feeling despondent, Takaki resigns from his job, unable to handle his feelings for Akari. Akari sifts through a box of old belongings and discovers the letter she had written to Takaki years earlier. Takaki finds himself in a convenience store, looking at a magazine featuring the rocket launch he witnessed long ago. As a popular song plays in the background, Takaki and Akari begin to narrate in tandem, both reminiscing about a recent dream. In this dream, they revisit their final encounter in the snowy Iwafune and recall their hope to one day enjoy the cherry blossoms together again.</p>
                <p>As Takaki and Akari stroll down a familiar road from their childhood, they catch sight of each other at a train crossing. Positioned on either side of the tracks, they pause and begin to reminisce, but the passing trains obscure their view. Takaki stands by as the trains go by, only to realize that Akari has disappeared. After a brief moment, he smiles to himself and walks on, as the cherry blossoms flutter in the wake of the train.</p>
