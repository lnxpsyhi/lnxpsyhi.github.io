    <h2>Who is Makoto Shinkai?</h2>
    <p>
      <span>The Japanese manga artist, animator, screenwriter, director, and cinematographer is Makoto Shinkai. He
        typically
        works alone to develop and write the stories for his animes, as well as to direct and oversee the
        cinematography.


        In 1999, Shinkai published She and Her Cat, a five-minute animated video that served as his debut animation.
        Voices of a Distant Star (2002), The Place Promised in Our Early Days (2004), 5 Centimeters Per Second (2007),
        Children Who Chase Lost Voices (2011), and The Garden of Words (2013) are just a few of the mainstream anime
        films
        he would go on to produce.

        His biggest hit, Your Name, was released in 2016 and was rated as the top body-swap movie by IMDb. In the same
        year, Variety named him one of the "10 Animators to Watch in 2016." Your Name surpassed Spirited Away from
        Studio
        Ghibli to become the highest-grossing anime film of all time in 2017. Game Rant claims that Your Name is
        currently
        the second-highest-grossing anime film of all time as of May 2021. In 2019, Shinkai released Weathering With
        You,
        another popular feature animation.

        He received a 'Letter of Appreciation' from the National Policy Unit of the Cabinet Secretariat in 2012,
        identifying him as one of the "Global Messengers of Japan."

    <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
    <p>On February 9, 1973, Makoto Niitsu, also called Makoto Shinkai, was born in Koumi, Nagano Prefecture, Japan.
      Shinkai has been a cat lover since he was a young boy and has continued to raise cats throughout his life. "Ever
      since I was a child I always had cats with me. I'm from the Nagano prefecture, and while living there I had cats,
      and after I came to Tokyo I also picked up some strays and started raising them. So I definitely always had cats
      with me," according to him.</p><br />
    <p>Beginning in middle school, Shinkai's love for drawing comics persisted throughout his time at the university. He
      attended Chuo University in Hachioji, Japan, to study Japanese literature. He drew children's picture books and
      was a member of the juvenile literature club at Chuo. Shinkai received his degree from Chuo University's Faculty
      of Letters in March 1996.
    </p><br />
    <h2>Early Career</h2>
    <p>Shinkai began working at the video game firm Falcom after graduating. He was employed by Falcom for five years as
      an artist, creating online designs and video clips for the company's games. His subsequent film career would be
      influenced by his stay at Falcom. At Falcom, he got to know Tenmon, a composer who would go on to score the
      majority of his movies.</p>

    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>Mitsuha Miyamizu, a high school student in Itomori, Japan, dreams of becoming a Tokyo boy. She intermittently
      switches bodies with Tokyo boy Taki Tachibana, living together and communicating through various means. Mitsuha
      sets Taki up on a date with Miki Okudera, while Taki helps Mitsuha become more popular. They visit a Shinto
      shrine, where Hitoha explains that God governs time and human connections. Taki goes on a date with Miki, but
      realizes he's falling for Mitsuha. The body-switching stops.</p><br />
    <p>Taki, Miki, and Tsukasa travel to Hida to search for Mitsuha. They find Itomori, a village devastated by
      fragments from a comet. Taki realizes he and Mitsuha were separated by three years, living in 2013 and 2016. He
      loses his memories of Mitsuha and has a vision of her giving him a red ribbon. Taki awakens in Mitsuha's body, and
      Mitsuha's friends help him evacuate Itomori. They cross timelines, allowing them to meet in person for the first
      time.</p>
    <br />
    <!-- <p>In a village, a woman forgets her father's evacuation plan and discovers he wrote "I love you" on her hand
      instead of his name. Five years later, a university graduate, he is obsessed with the impact of Tiamat and finds
      Mitsuha in Tokyo. They race to find each other.</p> -->
